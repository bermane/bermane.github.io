## About Me
With a background in mathematics and a passion for leveraging data to address complex challenges, my skill set is tailored to working with a variety of structured and unstructured data to develop cutting-edge products and services. I have an MSc in remote sensing and specialize in geospatial applications, including over 5 years of experience leading scientific studies. I have worked closely with diverse clients and stakeholders across government, industry and academia, from project conceptualization to preâ€‘processing large datasets, developing machine learning algorithms and delivering insights backed by publications. This website hosts some of my recent endeavors, with a focus on building models that fuse together distinct datasets from varied sources.
